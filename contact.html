    <!-- Hey do you see line 15 it looks like this:
     <form class=""action="index.html" method="post">
         before I change it you can notice that in this
          code in this commet the class is action="index.html"
           which means that when someone clicks on it the action
            will just take the user to our homepage-->
            <!-- we changed the action to ="mailto" what mailsto do is that 
            when you press the submit button, they will open up your default 
            mail client,and it puts in the email address that you specify -->
            <!--The post just means that it simply transfers what the user types into the input -->
